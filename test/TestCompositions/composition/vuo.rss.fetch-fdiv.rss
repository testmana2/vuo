 <title>Who were the jockeys in Muybridge&#039;s photographs?</title>
 <link>http://fdiv.net/2015/01/02/who-were-jockeys-muybridges-photographs</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Before 1878, few people knew what a galloping horse looked like in slow motion. That changed when Eadweard Muybridge, witnessed by the local press, used a clever apparatus to take a series of photographs as a horse galloped by. The result was &lt;a href=&quot;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Horse_in_Motion.jpg&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Sallie Gardner at a Gallop&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;, a.k.a. &amp;#8220;The Horse in Motion&amp;#8221;. Back then, you could watch the series of photographs as a movie on a zoopraxiscope. Today, you can watch it in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/VideoViewMuybridge.aspx&quot;&gt;online video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first became aware of this piece of history when my co-worker Karl Henkel made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://vuo.org/node/471&quot;&gt;colorful rendition&lt;/a&gt; of related photographs, &amp;#8220;Annie G. Galloping&amp;#8221; (pictured at right). I looked up the story behind these photographs, but it didn&amp;#8217;t answer the question I was wondering about: Who were the guys riding the&amp;nbsp;horses?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fellow wonderer, Kem Royale, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kemroyale.com/youve-got-to-know-that-you-know-that-you-know/race-card-black-man-was-first-motion-picture-movie-star-way-before-pickford-chaplin-valentino-keaton&quot;&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; just how odd this is: More is known about &lt;a href=&quot;http://foolishpleasure-valerie.blogspot.com/2009/03/sallie-gardner-horse-behind-photograph.html&quot;&gt;Sallie Gardner&lt;/a&gt;, the horse, than about either of the riders â€” even though they&amp;#8217;re arguably among the first people to star in a silent&amp;nbsp;film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, after much poking around the internet, I can provide a bit more information about these riders. I&amp;#8217;ve found a full name and pieced together a biography for a man who, I think, was the rider in &amp;#8220;Sallie Gardner at a Gallop&amp;#8221;, the mysterious G.&amp;nbsp;Domm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://fdiv.net/sites/default/files/SallieGardnerAnnieG.png&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;#039;Sallie Gardner at a Gallop&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Annie G. Galloping&amp;#039;, with names of horses and riders labeled&quot; title=&quot;&amp;#039;Sallie Gardner at a Gallop&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;Annie G. Galloping&amp;#039;, with names of horses and riders labeled&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
