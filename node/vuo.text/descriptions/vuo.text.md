These nodes are for working with text. 

These nodes use the UTF-8 encoding for the Unicode character set. This means that they can handle ASCII characters (such as the English/Latin alphabet) as well as other characters, such as accented characters and non-Latin alphabets. 

You can enter multiple lines of text into a text input editor by using Option-Return to insert line breaks.
