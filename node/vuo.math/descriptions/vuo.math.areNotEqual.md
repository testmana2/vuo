Outputs *false* if all values are close to equal, and *true* otherwise.

If there are no values, outputs *false*.

`Tolerance` is the maximum amount by which any two values can differ to still be considered equal. Because calculations on a computer are often inexact due to rounding errors, if working with real numbers, you would typically want to make `Tolerance` greater than 0.
