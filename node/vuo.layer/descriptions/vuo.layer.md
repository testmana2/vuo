These nodes are for working with layers to create composite images. 

Layers are a unique data type that are similar to images, but can be combined together as if they were stacked on top of one another. To create a layer, you can use one of the `Make Layer` nodes. To combine layers into a composite image, you can use one of the `Render Layers` nodes. 

When creating a layer from an image, you can choose whether the node should be rendered at **Real Size** â€” with each pixel in the original image drawn as a single pixel in the composite image. A Real-Size layer can be translated but can't be rotated or scaled. The `Make Layer` and `Make Layer with Shadow` nodes create a Real-Size layer, while the `Make Scaled Layer` and `Make Scaled Layer with Shadow` nodes do not.  

Several layer nodes, such as the `Is Point within Layer` node and the `Receive Mouse Drags on Layer` node use a Layer's name to detect what layer to act on. The `Layer Name` entered must exactly match the name in the original layer's `Layer Name` port. A name with a trailing space, for example, will not match a name without a trailing space.

In **Vuo Coordinates**, (0,0) is the center of the composite image. The composite image has a width of 2, with X-coordinate -1 on the left edge and 1 on the right edge. The composite image's height is determined by its aspect ratio, with the Y-coordinate increasing from bottom to top.
