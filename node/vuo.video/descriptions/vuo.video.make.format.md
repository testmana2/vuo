Creates the settings used to export a movie.

You can choose the encoding based on how you plan to use the movie. Some encodings are better for playing back and sharing movie files, while others are better for video editing. See the vuo.video node set documentation for details.

Some encodings allow you to control the level of quality, ranging from 0 (lowest) to 1 (highest). Higher qualities result in larger file sizes. The JPEG and H.264 image encodings and the AAC audio encoding allow changing the quality. For other encodings, the quality port has no effect.

The container for exported movies is always QuickTime (.mov).
