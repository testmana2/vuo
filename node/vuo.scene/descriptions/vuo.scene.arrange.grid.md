Moves objects so that they are evenly arranged in a 3D grid.

This node takes the first object and places it in the top, left, front of the grid, and it continues rightward, then downward, then back.

   - `Objects` — The objects to arrange in a grid.
   - `Scale To Fit` — If true, each object is scaled proportionately to fit within its grid cell. If false, objects' scales are left unaltered.
   - `Center` — The center position of the grid, in Vuo Coordinates.
   - `Width`, `Height`, and `Depth` — The size of the grid along the `X`, `Y`, and `Z` axis, in Vuo Coordinates.
   - `Rows`, `Columns`, and `Slices` — The number of grid cells along the `X`, `Y`, and `Z` axis.
