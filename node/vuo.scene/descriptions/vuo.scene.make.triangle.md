Creates a scene object in the shape of an equilateral triangle.

- `Transform` — A transform that changes the triangle's translation, rotation, or scale. It should use Vuo Coordinates.
- `Material` — A shader, image, or color to apply to the triangle. If no material is provided, this node uses a default shader that stretches a gradient-colored checkerboard across the triangle.

By default, the triangle is on the XY plane, with its point upward on the Y axis. It has sides of length 1, with its center of mass at (0,0,0).
