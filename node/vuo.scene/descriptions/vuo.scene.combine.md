Groups multiple 3D objects together and applies a transformation to the group.

This node is useful for building a 3D scene out of parts. For example, 3D objects that represent fingers can be grouped to create a hand; when the hand moves, all fingers move with it.

   - `Transform` — A transform that changes the group's translation, rotation, or scale. It should use Vuo Coordinates.
   - `Child Objects` — The 3D objects to put into a group.
