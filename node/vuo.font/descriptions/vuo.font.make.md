Creates a font description, to be used by a text rendering node (such as `Make Text Image`).

   - `Font Name` — The font's PostScript name.  For example, `Palatino-BoldItalic`.  To get the PostScript name for a font, open the Font Book application, select the font, then select Preview > Show Font Info.
   - `Point Size` — The size of the text, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(typography)">typographic points</a>.
   - `Underlined` — Whether a line is drawn underneath the text, typically for emphasis.
   - `Color` — The color of the text.
   - `Horizontal Alignment` — When rendering multiple lines of text, specifies which part of each line should be anchored.
   - `Character Spacing` — The distance from one character to the next.  A value of 1.0 (the default) is normal spacing.  Smaller values make the characters tighter; larger values make the characters looser.
   - `Line Spacing` — The distance from one line of text to the next.  A value of 1.0 (the default) is normal spacing.  Smaller values make the lines tighter; larger values make the lines looser.
