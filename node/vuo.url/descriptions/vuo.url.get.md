Gives information about the parts of a URL.

URLs are structured as follows: `scheme://user@host:port/path?query#fragment`

   - `Scheme` — The protocol used to access the data, such as `http`.
   - `User` — The URL's embedded authentication credentials.
   - `Host` — The network address the URL points to.
   - `Port` — The network port specified in the URL (or the Scheme's default port, if the URL doesn't explicitly specify a port).
   - `Path` — The hierarchical path to the URL's data.
   - `Query` — Non-hierarchical information clarifying the URL's request for data.
   - `Fragment` — The sub-resource to locate within the retrieved data.

(See also the `Get File URL Values` node.)
