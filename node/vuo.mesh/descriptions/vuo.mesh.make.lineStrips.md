Creates a mesh made up of a series of connected line segments. 

   - `Positions` — A list of the endpoints of the line segments. The 1st point and 2nd point are endpoints for one line segment, the 2nd point and 3rd point are endpoints for another line segment, and so on. 
   - `Line Width` — How wide to draw the lines, in Vuo Coordinates.

Even if the line segments connect to form a 2D or 3D object, they're rendered simply as line segments, not as a solid object.
