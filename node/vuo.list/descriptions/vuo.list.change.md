Replaces an item in a list.

`Position` is the number of the item to replace (1 for the first item, 2 for the second item, etc.). If `Position` is less than 1, the first item is replaced. If `Position` is greater than the number of items in the list, the last item is replaced.

If the input list doesnâ€™t contain any items, this node outputs an empty list.
